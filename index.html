    <h1>This is my first official heading</h1>
    <p>And this is my first official paragraph.  <br />
      It is kind of fun to write stuff on the internet, <br />
      but this isn't very pretty. <br />
      I wonder how I wrap text to fit the screen?</p>
      <p>I want to include some other things that I learned.</p>
      <div id="links">
        <h2>links</h2>
        <p> here is what I have learned about links:<br />
          <ol>
            <li>they can be internal</li>
            <li>they can be external</li>
            <li>they can be to different files</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Now I really need to space this out, because<br />
            for some reason the internal links I am <br />
            including are not working and now I am <br />
            getting frustrated.  I wonder if this will <br />
            show up on the screen or if I am doing something <br />
            wrong.

        <p>The image above shows a bear.</p>
        <p>I am going to have to figure out how to use other media files.</p>

        <p>The video above shows a bear playing in the water</p>
        <p>It is a cute bear, and the video is supported.  I think I am getting better at this.</p>
